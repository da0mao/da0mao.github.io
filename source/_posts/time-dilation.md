I am following these videos of "Your Daily Equation" and taking some notes here.
Time dilation was predicted by several authors at the turn of the 20th century. In June 1905, Einstein pointed that this effect concerns the nature of time itself.

Professor Green explained it with a "Light clock" and do the calculation in this [video](https://youtu.be/nnVq6gmatHU).

Here are some notes:
$L'^2=\Delta t^2_S c^2=L^2+v\Delta t^2_S$ (Pythagorean theorem)

thus,$L=\Delta t_S \sqrt{c^2-v^2}$

while $L=\Delta t_M c$

we have $\Delta t_S= \frac{\Delta t_M}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$

where $\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is called Lorentz factor.
