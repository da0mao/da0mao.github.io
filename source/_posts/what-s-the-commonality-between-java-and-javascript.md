Lots of new programmers and non-tech people have long confused Java and JavaScript, so what's the commonality? :smirk:

<!-- more -->

The answer is: they have the first four characters of their names in common...

I was actually looking for JS but ended up learning Java for quite some time! :scream:

But they both have inherited lots of syntaxes from C, so learning Java these days reminds me some of them which would be helpful as now I am heading to JS, hopefully.
